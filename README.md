# Thomas the Drank Engine - the all-in-one soda dispenser delivery system!

This soda system is made of two bluetooth-controlled components: The remote-control train and a drink dispenser. When a drink is ordered, the user can control the train and drive it towards the dispenser, which uses sonar to detect if the train is close enough, dropping a drink if so.
